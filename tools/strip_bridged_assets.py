"""
Remove from the shipped tree every file the asset bridge restores at runtime.

This is the other half of the bridge, and it is driven by the same manifest so the two
cannot drift: every path on the right-hand side of `asset-bridge.properties` is a file
this repository must NOT contain, because the bridge's whole purpose is to fetch that
file from a copy the player supplies instead.

    python tools/strip_bridged_assets.py --check     # fail if any bridged file is present
    python tools/strip_bridged_assets.py --dry-run   # list what would go
    python tools/strip_bridged_assets.py             # delete them

`--check` is the one that matters: it runs in the pre-publish audit and in CI, and it is
what stops a stray `git checkout` or a re-run of the old importer from quietly putting
Glitchfiend's art back into a public repository. It exits non-zero if anything is found.

Deleting is idempotent and safe to re-run. Empty directories left behind are removed too,
so the tree does not fill up with husks.
